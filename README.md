# Password-Generator

## What I Did

In this homework, I was to write the JavaScript for a Password Generating website. 
The parameters were:
* ask how many characters the user wants, between 8 and 128, inclusive.
* ask if the user wants upper case letters in their password
* ask if the user wants lower case letters in their password
* ask if the user wants numbers in their password
* ask if the user wants special characters in their password
Once all these values are stored, we are to give the user a randomly generated password using the selected character types.
